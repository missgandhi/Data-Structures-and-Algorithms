# DSA Resources Repository

Welcome to the **DSA Resources Repository**! ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** resources that I believe will be helpful for anyone on their journey to mastering DSA. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, improving problem-solving skills, or just exploring DSA concepts, this repo has something for everyone.

## What to Expect
- Curated lists of problem-solving resources from platforms like LeetCode, NeetCode, and others.
- Categorized problems by topics such as Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Trees, and more.
- Study plans, patterns, and cheat sheets for cracking interviews.
- Helpful articles, tutorials, and external links to dive deeper into concepts.

## Structure
Iâ€™ll be continuously updating and organizing the content into relevant sections:
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: A curated list of DP problems, including overlap with NeetCode and LeetCode questions.
- **Graphs and Trees**: Fundamental and advanced problems covering traversal, shortest paths, and more.
- **Arrays and Strings**: Popular problems for interviews with varying difficulty levels.
- **System Design Resources**: Tutorials, problem statements, and templates for designing scalable systems.
- **Cheat Sheets and Notes**: Key formulas, patterns, and techniques.

## Contribution
If you think thereâ€™s something I should add to the repository, feel free to reach out or submit a pull request!

## Acknowledgments
- Special thanks to resources like **LeetCode**, **NeetCode**, and other educational platforms that help learners worldwide.
- The DSA journey is ongoing, and I hope this repository becomes a helpful guide for everyone.

Letâ€™s grow and master DSA together! ðŸŒŸ
